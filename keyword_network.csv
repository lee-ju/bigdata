Focusing device,"A focusing device for focusing a photographic camera or the like on the image of an object to be photographed is arranged to control and adjust the operating time of each performance of a focus detecting process according to a signal produced from reflection light receiving means during a series of processes.

Acoustic signal optical correlator using a light emitting diode array,"An optical correlator using a light emitting diode array, in which analog gnals from two spaced sensors are correlated in order to locate and track a target. One signal is clipped and digitized and clocked through a shift register, and the other signal is delayed. The shift register is coupled to an LED array, element for element. Each shift register element modulates its corresponding LED element. The delayed signal is also connected at its output to the LED array via a transistor, and modulates each LED element. Therefore, the LED elements emit light in proportion to the product of the two signals. The emitted light is focused onto a CCD imaging array where it is integrated over a period of time before being sent to an integrator and output display device. The output is the correlation function versus the time delay between the two signals. Successive outputs display the movement of targets. Circuit design mitigates inherent errors within the system."
System for correcting time base error of information reproducing apparatus,A light emitted from a laser diode is reflected by a video disc which is rotated by a spindle motor. The reflected light is modulated by video information recorded on the video disc and converted to an electrical signal by a photodiode array. A signal generated by a trapezoidal generator is sampled with a horizontal synchronizing signal separated from the video information signal. The sampled signal is supplied to the spindle motor for correcting a time base error. A zero crossing point of the trapezoidal waveform is detected and is utilized for controlling the start of a rise portion of the trapezoidal waveform for compensating a DC offset. The trapezoidal waveform is controlled so as to vary an average power supplied to the spindle motor in accordance with a detected rotational speed difference so as to compensate a rotational speed of the spindle motor.

The frequency of the clock signal is variable to adjust the turn-on time of the light emitting elements as desired."
